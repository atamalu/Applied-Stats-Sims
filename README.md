# Applied Statistics: Simulation Studies
This project contains elaborate examples of common statistical models using simulated data from hypothetical studies. Each markdown simulates, visualizes, and models the data. These steps are followed by an easily-understandable interpretation of the results in terms of the study. For more complex designs, the logic behind most steps are also explained (see: factorial multilevel model).

I started writing these markdowns for 2 purposes:
1. To demonstrate how to different models can be used to test hypotheses
2. To give examples of applying some of these models without "perfect" data

<p>By this, I am referring to the fact that almost all online examples use data that fulfill all statistical assumptions and are devoid of issues in analysis. This is incredibly unrealistic. Data acquired from the real world tends to be more sloppy. Because of this, you will often run into issues when preparing for or performing analyses that requires user-specific knowledge and actual thinking to solve.

## Multilevel modeling

### [Factorial](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/Multilevel_Factorial/Multilevel_Factorial.md)
* Does exercise affect the brain's response to uncontrollable stress?
* Does a subject's sex affect the brain's response to uncontrollable stress?
* Does the effect of exercise depend on the subject's sex?

## Regression

### [Simple](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/Simple_Regression/simple_regression.md)
* How does adjusting the pricing of a product affect the quantity sold?

### Multiple

### Logistic

### Poisson

## ANOVA

### [t-test (AB test)]
* Does introducing an at-work socialization period affect employee satisfaction ratings?

### [One-way](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/one_way_anova/one_way_anova.md)
* Is drug treatment effective in treating social anxiety?
* Is one drug more effective than the other?

### Two-way/Factorial

### Repeated measures

### Transformations
