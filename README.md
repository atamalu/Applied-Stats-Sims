# Applied Statistics: Simulation Studies
This project contains elaborate examples of common statistical models using simulated data from hypothetical studies. Each markdown simulates, visualizes, and models the data. These steps are followed by an easily-understandable interpretation of the results in terms of the study. For more complex designs, the logic behind most steps are also explained (see: factorial multilevel model).

I started writing these markdowns to demonstrate how different models can be used to test hypotheses

## Multilevel modeling

### [Factorial](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/Multilevel_Factorial/Multilevel_Factorial.md)
* Does exercise affect the brain's response to uncontrollable stress?
* Does a subject's sex affect the brain's response to uncontrollable stress?
* Does the effect of exercise depend on the subject's sex?

## Regression

### [Simple](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/Simple_Regression/simple_regression.md)
* How does adjusting the price of a product affect the quantity sold?

### Multiple
* Does a restaurant's ratings affect revenue after controlling for the area's median income?

### [Logistic](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/Logistic_Regression/Logistic_Regression.md)
* Do longer allocated loan repayment periods increase the odds of making the first 6 months of payments on-time?
* Is there a difference between the 2 longer pay periods?

### Poisson
* How does the win-loss ratio affect the number of touchdowns a team scores in a football game?

### Survival
* How do we predict the number of days customers will go between visits?

## ANOVA

### [t-test (AB test)](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/t_test/t_test.md)
* Does introducing an at-work socialization period affect employee satisfaction ratings?

### [One-way](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/one_way_anova/one_way_anova.md)
* Is drug treatment effective in treating social anxiety?
* Is one drug more effective than the other?

### Two-way/Factorial
see: multilevel factorial section

### Repeated measures (mixed ANOVA)
* How does being a weekday or weekend impact attendance of an art showcase?
* Does attendance differ between any of the 3 months?

### Transformation
* Logit (proportions)
* Ladder of powers
